Data Types in JavaScript:

1.strings: A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".
           Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes.
           You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string.
Ex: var str = "Hi, I am a robot";


2.Numbers: JavaScript has only one type of numbers.
           Numbers can be written with, or without decimals.
Ex: var a = 100;


3.Booleans: Booleans can only have two values: true or false.
            Booleans are often used in conditional testing.
Ex: var x = 5;
    var y = 5;
    var z = 6;
    (x == y)       // Returns true
    (x == z)       // Returns false


4.Arrays: JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.
          Array items are separated by commas.
          Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.
Ex: var colors = ["Black","White","Blue"];


5.Objects: JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.
           Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.
Ex: var person = {name: "Bhagi", age: 20, hobby:"Coding"};
